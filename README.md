## **Overview**

GreenGains/Trash2Treasure is a simple solution to incentivize waste reduction and recycling efforts in Duke’s West Campus dormitories. It encourages individuals to participate actively in sustainability initiatives by offering rewards (food point bonuses, vouchers/gift cards, etc.) which scale off of how many “points” an individual scores by recycling and reducing landfill waste. 

Scoring is based off of the following model: 

Points (per individual) = (# of cardboard containers recycled) + 2 * (# of bottles recycled) + 2 * (# of cans recycled) 

Additionally, users may earn extra points by hitting certain checkpoints (e.g. 10 cans recycled, 20 boxes/cardboard containers recycled, 50 total items recycled). Scores will reset every two weeks, and during this period, the scores among dorms will be tallied. The dorms with the most points per resident (total points within the dorm / no. of residents, as some dorms have more people than others) will receive rewards such as extra food points (see this article) or coupons/vouchers/gift cards for on-campus stores. 

2 real-time leaderboards will display the recycling rankings of all seven dormitories as well as the points leaders throughout all of West Campus. This program is meant to encourage healthy competition among quads while also raising awareness for sustainable practices. 

## **Future Considerations**

Implement NetID Login System
    - Currently impossible due to OIT and time restrictions
Shift Away From Honor Systesm
    - Mandatory photographs
    - Weighted trash bins
    - Manual inspections
Changing the Scoring System
    - Factor in % of landfill waste reduced
